		<hr/>The strength of EAGLE lies in its minimalistic subgrid recipes and the systematic exploration of alterations: Besides the reference model (L0100N1504REFERENCE), a series of simulations with parameter variations have been run to explore the impact of various choices in the subgrid implementations, including the style and strength of supernova feedback, AGN heating and criteria for when stars are formed Crain2015.  <span class='evaluation'>(681,long,clauses,stopwords)</span>
<hr/>no accretion, and therefore no AGN detection 89 , nearby gas leading to obscuration and triggering of a faint AGN 10 , either in the onset of a merger or due to secular events, major merger triggering a bright AGN, which immediately clears the vertically extended obscurer but shines for a period of time 1 before fading. <span class='evaluation'>(670,long,clauses,stopwords)</span>
<hr/>Two cases are important: (1) the fraction of obscured AGN at the bright end (), where the lowest obscured fractions are observed (, shown as triangles), and (2) at the faint end (), where the highest obscured fractions are observed (, shown as squares). <span class='evaluation'>(640,long,clauses)</span>
<hr/>The Evolution and Assembly of Galaxies and their Environment (EAGLE) simulation Schaye2015,Crain2015 reproduces many observed quantities; it reproduces very well the stellar mass function Furlong2015a and size distribution Furlong2015 of galaxies as a function of cosmic time, being tuned to reproduce these at X. <span class='evaluation'>(500,long)</span>
<hr/>We discuss three aspects which affect the results: (1) different sub-grid physics, most notably stronger feedback mechanisms, (2) differences between active and passive galaxies, (3) unresolved substructure of the gas. <span class='evaluation'>(480,long,clauses)</span>
<hr/>Each of these three modification (eos1, ViscHi, AGNdT9) leads to a reduction of the obscured fraction of AGN (see Figure ), while contrary modifications (eos5/3, ViscLo, AGNdT8) do the opposite. <span class='evaluation'>(470,long,clauses)</span>
<hr/>We use this in the following sections to disentangle the AGN nuclear obscurer from the galaxy-scale obscurer (Section ), and to describe their behaviour as a function of accretion luminosity, host galaxy stellar mass and redshift (Section ). <span class='evaluation'>(460,long,clauses)</span>
<hr/>Additionally, studies comparing the morphology of active and passive galaxies have found little evidence that these are different, by comparing appearances with asymmetry and concentration measures Grogin2003,Grogin2005,Pierce2007,Gabor2009,Kocevski2012 or visual classification Kocevski2012. <span class='evaluation'>(460,long,clauses)</span>
<hr/>Semi-analytic models, relying on dark matter haloes from dark matter N-body simulations have been highly successful in reproducing many features of galaxies, including the stellar mass function of galaxies and their colour distribution Croton2006,Somerville2008,Hirschmann2012,Fanidakis2012. <span class='evaluation'>(450,long,clauses)</span>
<hr/>Galaxy-galaxy mergers are today thought to be the main trigger of luminous AGN activity, because SMBH need to accrete substantial fractions of their host galaxy gas (as shown by scaling relations), within durations comparable to dynamical timescales of galaxy centres Somerville2008. <span class='evaluation'>(440,long,clauses)</span>
<hr/>This simple limit is shown for several levels of obscuration in Figure X. Risaliti1999 already noted that such large masses at radii further than a few 10 pc are ruled out in NGC1068 and Circinus because they would gravitationally dominate the central region. <span class='evaluation'>(424,long,stopwords)</span>
<hr/>This relation was derived from actively star forming galaxies, therefore a caveat is that results may slightly over-represent the galaxy gas present in AGN host galaxies which have average Rosario2011,Rosario2013,Santini2012 or even below-average Mullaney2015 star formation rates. <span class='evaluation'>(400,long)</span>
<hr/>As an example, lets consider that a merges into a galaxy (minor merger), and lets assume that all of its gas () is made available. <span class='evaluation'>(371,long,clauses,stopwords)</span>
<hr/>The evolutionary model also explains why bright AGN are less frequently found to be mildly obscured than faint AGN Ueda2003,Silverman2008,Ebrero2009,Ueda2014,Buchner2015,Aird2015, albeit only qualitatively Hopkins2005,Hopkins2006OriginModel. <span class='evaluation'>(370,long,clauses)</span>
<hr/>The mass-dependence is defined by the parameter: at , the PuffedTorus is mass-independent, corresponding to a strict luminosity-dependent unified model, while at it is only Eddington-rate dependent. <span class='evaluation'>(365,long,clauses,stopwords)</span>
<hr/>X-ray surveys consistently find a strong decline towards high luminosities Ueda2003,Hasinger2005,LaFranca2005,Ebrero2009,Ueda2014,Buchner2015,Aird2015 of the obscured fraction in the Compton-thin AGN (CTNAGN) population. <span class='evaluation'>(360,long,clauses)</span>
<hr/>We also point out that Illustris uses relative strong feedback, as it implements three different AGN feedback schemes (thermal, kinetic and radiation), whereas EAGLE uses only stochastic heating.  <span class='evaluation'>(350,long,clauses)</span>
<hr/>This has been found in many works Ueda2003,Ebrero2009,LaFranca2005,Ueda2014,Aird2015 by fitting a empirical, parametric model to the relative number density derived from AGN surveys. <span class='evaluation'>(350,long,clauses)</span>
<hr/>The EAGLE reference simulation in a large cosmological volume (L0100N1504REFERENCE) belongs to the latter group, as well as the simulation run in medium-size volumes (L0025N0752REFERENCE, L0025N0752RECALIBRATED). <span class='evaluation'>(350,long,clauses)</span>
<hr/>However, the Milky Way and local galaxies are limited in their use as templates for the high-redshift universe, specifically at peak SMBH growth (; e.g., Aird2010). <span class='evaluation'>(350,long,clauses)</span>
<hr/>Figure shows results from surveys at the peak of the accretion history ( panels) from Ueda2014 and Buchner2015, as well as surveys which include the local Universe Burlon2011,Ueda2014,Aird2015,Ricci2016. <span class='evaluation'>(350,long,clauses)</span>
<hr/>When comparing the triangle data points at in Figure representing the bright end to our results (red), we find broad agreement within two-sigma uncertainties (red shades). <span class='evaluation'>(340,long,clauses)</span>
<hr/>The gas particle resolution in Illustris is adaptive, with some cells being as small as in the highest resolution simulation (Illustris-1) used here, indicating that modern cosmological simulation indeed resolve galaxies into small sub-structures. <span class='evaluation'>(340,long,clauses)</span>
<hr/>Red lines show our fraction of obscured AGN (y-axis) for a given column density (x-axis), assuming various SMF and SARDs, with shades showing the uncertainties stemming from the obscuration relation. <span class='evaluation'>(340,long,clauses)</span>
<hr/>In fact, since active galaxies are preferentially gas-rich, star-forming galaxies in that simulation, the average column density is higher by a factor of 2, which increases the discrepancy. <span class='evaluation'>(340,long,clauses)</span>
<hr/>Hence Matt2000 proposed a two-phase model for the obscuration of AGN: a central, nuclear obscurer which provides Compton-thick obscuration, and the host galaxy, which provides mildly obscured lines of sight. <span class='evaluation'>(340,long,clauses)</span>
<hr/>Black hole mass downsizing has evidence from optical observations of the black hole mass function evolution Schulze2010,Kelly2013a,Schulze2015 and semi-analytic models which reproduce the evolution of the AGN luminosity function Fanidakis2012,Enoki2014,Hirschmann2014. <span class='evaluation'>(340,long,clauses)</span>
<hr/>Adopting an appropriate skewed normal distribution with skew parameter (tail to low masses) around , we find that approximately reproduces the width of the obscured fraction function reported in Burlon2011, and peaks at X. <span class='evaluation'>(340,long,clauses)</span>
<hr/>Combining this simple limit with the masses of Figure , we can now conclude that galaxies simply do not have the required gas to provide Compton-thick obscurers with substantial covering factors outside the central X. <span class='evaluation'>(325,long,stopwords)</span>
<hr/>We focus on the metal component of gas as O and Fe are, for the relevant obscuring columns and redshifts, the most important elements for photo-electric absorption of X-rays. <span class='evaluation'>(324,long,stopwords)</span>
<hr/>Infrared studies remain however difficult to use as a constraint as the entire infrared SED has to be constrained for each object Netzer2016 and covering factors have to be corrected based on uncertain model geometries Stalevski2016.  <span class='evaluation'>(324,long,stopwords)</span>
<hr/>In this work we investigate the obscuring role of galaxy-scale gas in the transition from obscured AGN in gas-rich galaxies to unobscured AGN in gas-poor galaxies, as proposed in the evolutionary sequence of that model. <span class='evaluation'>(324,long,stopwords)</span>
<hr/>Here we apply this observational relation to the AGN population, and find that galaxy-scale gas is responsible for a luminosity-independent fraction of Compton-thin AGN, but does not produce Compton-thick columns. <span class='evaluation'>(323,long,stopwords)</span>
<hr/>In the hydro-dynamical simulations of Wada2012 very high accretion luminosities are associated with strong outflows, which suppress the vertical extent of the obscuring structure as they occupy larger angles. <span class='evaluation'>(321,long,stopwords)</span>
<hr/>Also the obscuration in the AGN host galaxy NGC 1068 is clearly nuclear (in this work: or smaller), because its Compton-thick column is observed in a face-on galaxy Matt1997a. <span class='evaluation'>(321,long,stopwords)</span>
<hr/>An open question is whether the same gas reservoir is responsible for fuelling the AGN by accretion onto Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs), and whether it itself is affected by AGN activity. <span class='evaluation'>(320,long,stopwords)</span>
<hr/>Under the assumption of black hole mass downsizing, i.e., that the average accreting black hole is more massive at high redshift than at low redshift, the turn-over luminosity decreases over cosmic time. <span class='evaluation'>(300,long)</span>
<hr/>Towards the Galactic Center columns with can be found in the Central Molecular Zone Morris1996,Molinari2011, as well as in the equivalent central zones of nearby AGN host galaxies Prieto2014. <span class='evaluation'>(300,long)</span>
<hr/>To summarise, luminous AGN and faint AGN may live in different environments with different gas reservoirs feeding them; therefore unifying the obscuration properties of a luminosity-dependent torus may not be appropriate.  <span class='evaluation'>(300,long)</span>
<hr/>This simulation also reproduces many observed quantities; most relevant for this work is that it reproduces the morphology of galaxies, the gas content from CO observations Vogelsberger2014,Genel2014. <span class='evaluation'>(300,long)</span>
<hr/>This paper is organised as follows: In Section we present our computation of the galaxy-scale obscuration using observational results from Paper I of the obscuring column distribution of galaxies, applied to the AGN population. <span class='evaluation'>(300,long)</span>
<hr/>This model was expanded by Hopkins2006OriginModel to reproduce local scaling relationships between galaxy components and SMBH masses, the luminosity function of AGN, the fraction of active galaxies, and the obscuration dichotomy of AGN. <span class='evaluation'>(300,long)</span>
<hr/>This Voronoi tessellation ray tracer can be found at https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/LightRayRiderhttps://github.com/JohannesBuchner/LightRayRider; Catalogues of the obscuration of all considered simulated galaxies are available from the first author on request. <span class='evaluation'>(300,long)</span>
<hr/>On the other hand, many nearby, obscured AGN are hosted in edge-on galaxies Maiolino1995, which suggests that dust-lanes may also be important obscurers see also for galactic optical/infrared extinction Goulding2009. <span class='evaluation'>(300,long)</span>
<hr/>Note that our results are meaningful for the AGN population -- the obscuration of individual host galaxies is stellar-mass dependent with substantial variations between individual galaxies (see Equation ). <span class='evaluation'>(300,long)</span>
<hr/>Indeed, our results remain unchanged if in the EAGLE reference simulation we only consider simulated galaxies with instantaneous black hole accretion rates corresponding to , assuming a radiative efficiency of 10 and bolometric corrections of Marconi2004. <span class='evaluation'>(300,long)</span>
<hr/>Further relevant for this work it also produces galaxies with realistic galaxy morphologies Schaye2015 and gas contents consistent with observations of CO and HI Bahe2015 as well as H Lagos2015. <span class='evaluation'>(300,long)</span>
<hr/>Evidence for this number comes directly from AGN surveys Buchner2015, matching the soft and hard X-ray luminosity function Aird2015 and matching the Compton-thin X-ray luminosity function to the spectrum of the Cosmic X-ray background Ueda2014. <span class='evaluation'>(300,long)</span>
<hr/>At higher column densities, the large-scale galaxy gas of the EAGLE reference simulation produces covering fractions consistent with the observations, with no need for a nuclear obscurer up to X. <span class='evaluation'>(300,long)</span>
<hr/>The PuffedTorus model consists of a Compton-thick component () and a Compton-thin component (), which is present depending on black hole mass and luminosity. <span class='evaluation'>(50,clauses)</span>
<hr/>Star formation-related feedback (supernovae, stellar winds, radiation pressure, cosmic rays) was altered in the WeakFB and StrongFB models. <span class='evaluation'>(50,clauses)</span>
<hr/>More accurately, these authors measure the specific accretion rate distribution (SARD), , where is the X-ray luminosity. <span class='evaluation'>(50,clauses)</span>
<hr/>comm., see Scannapieco2012,Schaller2015,Cui2016,Sembolini2016 in the present non-classical SPH simulations. <span class='evaluation'>(40,clauses)</span>
<hr/>The Milky Way gas distribution shows column densities of , but only in very low Galactic latitudes (, Dickey1990,Kalberla2005GalNHdist). <span class='evaluation'>(40,clauses)</span>
<hr/>That is, at every luminosity (not considering the Eddington limit), the same mix of host stellar masses contribute. <span class='evaluation'>(40,clauses)</span>
<hr/>Modern cosmological hydro-dynamic simulations self-consistently evolve galaxies and their processes (star formation, gas accretion, supernova and AGN feedback, etc.) <span class='evaluation'>(40,clauses)</span>
<hr/>The PuffedTorus model has few parameters and is constructed so that it reproduces the fraction of obscured AGN as a function of redshift and luminosity as discussed above. <span class='evaluation'>(31,stopwords)</span>
<hr/>The strength of EAGLE is that we can explore how variations of the physics affect the results. <span class='evaluation'>(30,stopwords)</span>
<hr/>The plot is made in the same fashion as the previous observational Figure and compares against the same observations. <span class='evaluation'>(30,stopwords)</span>
<hr/>For each we randomly assign a luminosity according to the SARD of Aird2012 and use only those with X. <span class='evaluation'>(30,stopwords)</span>
