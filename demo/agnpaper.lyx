The

torus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 obscurer of Active Galactic Nuclei, is poorly understood in terms of its
 density, substructure and physical mechanisms.
 Large X-ray surveys provide model boundary constraints, for both Compton-thin
 and Compton-thick levels of obscuration, as obscured fractions are mean
 covering factors 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\text{cov}}$
\end_inset

.
 However, a major remaining uncertainty is host galaxy obscuration.
 In Paper I we discovered a relation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH\propto M_{\star}^{1/3}$
\end_inset

 for the obscuration of galaxy-scale gas.
 Here we apply this observational relation to the AGN population, and find
 that galaxy-scale gas is responsible for a luminosity-independent fraction
 of Compton-thin AGN, but does not produce Compton-thick columns.
 With the host galaxy obscuration understood, we present a model of the
 remaining, nuclear obscurer which is consistent with a range of observations.
 The PuffedTorus model consists of a Compton-thick component (
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\text{cov}}\sim35\%$
\end_inset

) and a Compton-thin component (
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\text{cov}}\sim40\%$
\end_inset

), which is present depending on black hole mass and luminosity.
 This is a useful summary of observational constraints for torus modellers
 who would like to reproduce this behaviour.
 It can also be employed as a sub-grid recipe in cosmological simulations
 which do not resolve the torus.
 We also investigate host-galaxy X-ray obscuration inside cosmological,
 hydro-dynamic simulations (EAGLE, Illustris).
 The obscuration from ray-traced galaxy gas can agree with observations,
 but is highly sensitive to the chosen feedback assumptions.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The vast majority of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are obscured by thick
 columns of gas and dust.
 X-ray surveys over the last decade indicate that 
\begin_inset Formula $20-40\%$
\end_inset

 are hidden behind Compton-thick column densities (
\begin_inset Formula $\NH\apprge10^{24}\text{cm}^{-2}$
\end_inset

) and of the remaining population, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim75\%$
\end_inset

 are obscured with 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH=10^{22}-10^{24}\text{cm}^{-2}$
\end_inset

\end_inset

 at the peak of AGN activity at redshift 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.5-3$
\end_inset

.
 An open question is whether the same gas reservoir is responsible for fuelling
 the AGN by accretion onto Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs), and whether
 it itself is affected by AGN activity.
 To address this, the first step is to identify the scale at which the obscuring
 gas resides.
 Traditionally, AGN obscuration is associated with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

torus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, a nuclear (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim10\text{pc}$
\end_inset

) structure around the accretion disk.
 Many basic questions about this gas reservoir remain to be answered, including
 its density, substructure and stability mechanism 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Elitzur2006a,Hoenig2013"

\end_inset

.
 Assuming sampling from random viewing angles, the high fraction of obscured
 AGN implies large covering fractions.
 Therefore turbulent structures such as winds from accretion disks have
 been invoked.
 However, for the covering fractions to be useful constraints for torus
 models, the importance of galaxy-scale gas to the obscuration has to be
 estimated.
 Separating the covering and column densities from nuclear and galaxy-scale
 obscurers is the goal of this work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Local galaxies exemplify that several scales can contribute to the obscured
 columns.
 The Milky Way gas distribution shows column densities of 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH>10^{22}\text{cm}^{-2}$
\end_inset

, but only in very low Galactic latitudes (
\begin_inset Formula $|b|\apprle2\text{°}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp

\end_inset

).
 Towards the Galactic Center columns with 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH>10^{24}\text{cm}^{-2}$
\end_inset

 can be found in the Central Molecular Zone 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and in the equivalent central zones of nearby AGN host galaxies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Prieto2014"

\end_inset

.
 Also the obscuration in the AGN host galaxy NGC
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

1068 is clearly nuclear (in this work: 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim100\text{pc}$
\end_inset

 or smaller), because its Compton-thick column is observed in a face-on
 galaxy 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Matt1997a"

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, many nearby, obscured AGN are hosted in edge-on galaxies
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Maiolino1995"

\end_inset

, which suggests that dust-lanes may also be important obscurers

 Hence 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 proposed a two-phase model for the obscuration of AGN: a central, nuclear
 obscurer which provides Compton-thick obscuration, and the host galaxy,
 which provides mildly obscured lines of sight.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Some obscured AGN are clearly unobscured in other lines-of-sight.
 The strongest evidence for this comes from cones of ionised gas which show
 the Thomson-scattered spectra of unobscured AGN 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Antonucci1982"

 The inner obscurer thus must leave some lines-of-sight (LOS) unobscured.

However, the Milky Way and local galaxies are limited in their use as templates
 for the high-redshift universe, specifically at peak SMBH growth (

\end_inset

; e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp

 At that time, the gas content in galaxies was probably higher, as indicated
 by molecular gas measurements 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 which perhaps lead to the peak of star formation

In the semi-empirical model of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Hopkins2006OriginModel"

\end_inset

, the merging of galaxies makes gas available for both star formation and
 SMBH growth, leading to an initially long obscured phase followed by a
 short, bright AGN feedback phase which removes the obscuring gas.
 In the most extreme simulations, AGN feedback removes a high fraction of
 the global galactic gas, leaving behind a red and dead elliptical without
 subsequent star formation or SMBH growth

 SMBH masses, the luminosity function of AGN, the fraction of active galaxies,
 and the obscuration dichotomy of AGN.

In this work we investigate the obscuring role of galaxy-scale gas in the
 transition from obscured AGN in gas-rich galaxies to unobscured AGN in
 gas-poor galaxies, as proposed in the evolutionary sequence of that model.
 To effectively decouple the galaxy-scale and nuclear X-ray obscurer, we
 need to go beyond a single, central source.

Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Methodology"

\end_inset

Our goal is to predict the fraction of obscured AGN from the obscuration
 of host galaxy-scale gas alone, i.e.
 without nuclear obscuration (the torus and central molecular zones).
 In this fashion we will be able to separate the large-scale and small-scale
 obscurer.
 In Paper I we established a relation between the distribution of X-ray
 absorbing column densities, 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH$
\end_inset

, in galaxies and the stellar mass of the galaxy.
 It follows approximately a normal distribution around 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\NH=10^{21.7}\text{cm}^{-2}\times\left(M_{\star}/10^{9.5}M_{\odot}\right)^{1/3}\label{eq:NHM-rel}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with standard deviation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=0.5\,\text{dex}$
\end_inset

.
 This 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH-M_{\star}$
\end_inset

 relation was derived using an unbiased sample of long Gamma Ray Bursts
 (LGRBs)
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
 and is depicted in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:MNH-rel"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Because the obscuration is host mass dependent, the obscurer is arguably
 the host galaxy itself.
 In Paper I we show that modern cosmological hydro-dynamic simulations reproduce
 absorption by galaxy-scale metal gas and predict 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH-M_{\star}$
\end_inset

 relations very similar to Equation
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:NHM-rel"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We apply this relation to the AGN host galaxy population to estimate host
 galaxy obscuration.
 This relation was derived from actively star forming galaxies, therefore
 a caveat is that results may slightly over-represent the galaxy gas present
 in AGN host galaxies which have average 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Rosario2011,Rosario2013,Santini2012"

\end_inset

 or even below-average 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Mullaney2015"

\end_inset

 star formation rates.
 The major benefit of using this relationship is that it is based on the
 same observable as AGN obscured fractions, namely the photo-electric absorption
 of X-rays.
 Paper I also investigated the host galaxy metallicity bias of LGRB and
 concluded that it has a negligible effect on the obscurer.
 Local galaxies are also shown there to follow the 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH-M_{\star}$
\end_inset

 relation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start with the stellar mass function (SMF) of the galaxy population.
 Its shape 
\begin_inset Formula $P(M_{\star}|z)$
\end_inset

 is approximately a Schechter function and was measured by e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Muzzin2013"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Ilbert2013"

\end_inset

 out to 
\begin_inset Formula $z\sim4$
\end_inset

.
 Then we populate the galaxies with AGN.
 The occupation probability 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\text{AGN}|M_{\star},z)$
\end_inset

 has been measured by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Aird2012"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bongiorno2012"

\end_inset

 primarily for the redshift interval 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.5-2$
\end_inset

.
 More accurately, these authors measure the specific accretion rate distribution
 (SARD), 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\LX|M_{\star},z)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\LX$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $2-10\,\text{keV}$
\end_inset

 X-ray luminosity.
 They find factorised powerlaw relationships of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\LX|M_{\star},z)=A\cdot L_{{\rm X}}^{\gamma_{L}}\cdot M_{\star}^{\gamma_{M}}\cdot(1+z)^{\gamma_{z}}$
\end_inset

.
 At the highest luminosities, an Eddington limit is required to explain
 the steep decrease in the luminosity function 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Aird2013"

\end_inset

.
 In this work, however, we focus on the luminosity range 
\begin_inset Formula $\LX=10^{42-45}\text{erg/s}$
\end_inset

 regime and thus use only the observed relation.
 The final ingredient is the obscuring column density distribution (CDD)
 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\NH|M_{\star})$
\end_inset

, which is given by Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:NHM-rel"

\end_inset

 as a normal distribution in 
\begin_inset Formula $\log\NH$
\end_inset

.
 We assume that the galaxy-scale gas is independent of nuclear activity
 for individual galaxies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The obscured fraction can then be simply computed by Monte Carlo simulations.
 Analytically we can put the three distributions together as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P(\NH,\LX,M_{\star}|z)=\underbrace{P(M_{\star}|z)}_{\text{SMF}}\times\underbrace{P(\LX|M_{\star},z)}_{\text{SARD}}\times\underbrace{P(\NH|M_{\star})}_{\text{Eq 1}}\label{eq:combination}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

After inserting the factorised powerlaw relationship of the SARD, the result
 has the form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P(\NH,\LX,M_{\star}|z)=A\times L_{X}^{\gamma_{L}}\times f(M_{\star}|z)\times P(\NH|M_{\star}).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

While the absolute probability of finding an AGN is a function of luminosity,
 the mass distribution is independent of luminosity.
 That is, at every luminosity (not considering the Eddington limit), the
 same mix of host stellar masses contribute.
 Therefore, the implication is that the galaxy-scale gas obscuration is
 the same at all AGN luminosities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We adopt an AGN definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\LX>10^{42}\text{erg/s}$
\end_inset

.
 The frequency distribution of column densities 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH$
\end_inset

 for the AGN population is then computed by integrating over stellar mass
 and luminosity:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P(\NH|z)=\int\int_{10^{42}\text{erg/s}}^{\infty}P(\NH,\LX,M_{\star}|z)\,d\LX\,dM_{\star}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally the obscured AGN fraction is the cumulative distribution, i.e.
 the frequency of AGN being covered by a certain column density threshold
 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH$
\end_inset

 or higher: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f_{\text{cov}}(>\NH)=\int_{\NH}^{\infty}P(\NH'|z)d\NH'.\label{eq:fcov}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Into the calculation of 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\text{cov}}$
\end_inset

 we propagate the uncertainties from the obscuration relation for Paper
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

I.
 We consider two SMF (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Muzzin2013"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Aird2012"

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Bongiorno2012"

 To summarise, we rely only on observational relations to predict the obscuratio
n of the AGN population by galaxy-scale gas.

Galaxy-scale obscuration of AGN

Galaxy-scale obscuration of AGN.
 At various redshift intervals we show the fraction of AGN (y-axis) that
 is covered by a given column density 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH$
\end_inset

 (x-axis).
 Red lines indicate our derivations with uncertainties shown in red shades.
 Galaxy-scale obscuration is negligible for column densities of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{24}{\rm cm}^{-2}$
\end_inset

, but a important contributor to the AGN fraction at 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH\approx10^{22-23}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$
\end_inset

.
 Data points represent fractions from AGN surveys: Bright AGN (large triangles)
 show lower obscurations than faint AGN (squares).
 The data points are black, yellow, green small symbols 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and black and coloured large triangles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Burlon2011,Buchner2015"

\end_inset

.
 Because AGN also have a nuclear obscurer, these should be regarded as upper
 limits for galaxy gas obscuration (red).
 Arguable consistent with all data points is a normal distribution around
 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{22}{\rm cm}^{-2}$
\end_inset

 (dashed grey curve), which is kept constant across panels.

\begin_layout Standard
Firstly, galaxy-scale gas does not provide Compton-thick column densities
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\NH>\sigma_{T}^{-1}=1.5\times10^{24}{\rm cm}^{-2}$
\end_inset

).
 This is because massive galaxies which reach those densities are rare and
 therefore represent a negligible fraction of the AGN population.
 In contrast, the observed fraction of Compton-thick AGN is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim38\%$
\end_inset

 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Buchner2015"

\end_inset

 and references therein).
 We can conclude that Compton-thick obscuration is always associated with
 the nuclear region.
 An alternative, theoretical argument based on the total metal gas mass
 present in galaxies is laid out in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:semi-analytic"

\end_inset

 and arrives at the same conclusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We therefore focus on the Compton-thin obscurer.
 This step implicitly assumes that the Compton-thick nuclear obscurer is
 randomly oriented with respect to the galaxy, in accordance with chaotic
 accretion 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "King2006"

\end_inset

.
 We now compare with measurements of the obscured fraction of Compton-thin
 AGN from surveys.
 When these fractions are treated as covering fractions, they contain both
 galaxy-scale obscuration and nuclear obscuration.
 Therefore the data points should always be understood as upper limits to
 the galaxy-scale gas obscuration.

 AGN.
 Two cases are important: (1) the fraction of obscured AGN at the bright
 end (
\begin_inset Formula $\LX\geq10^{45}\text{erg/s}$
\end_inset

), where the lowest obscured fractions are observed (
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\text{bright}}\sim40\%$

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $f_{\text{faint}}\sim75\%$
\end_inset

 Our results are, as discussed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, luminosity-independent.

 representing the bright end to our results (red), we find broad agreement
 within two-sigma uncertainties (red shades).
 However, due to the large uncertainties also the faint end may agree.
 Therefore we cannot distinguish whether galaxy-scale obscuration decreases
 toward the bright end, or increases toward the faint end.
 Nevertheless we can conclude that galaxy-scale obscuration is an important,
 if not dominant, AGN obscurer at 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH=10^{22-23}\text{cm}^{-2}$
\end_inset

.
 At higher column densities, e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH=10^{23.5}\text{cm}^{-2}$
\end_inset

, the observed obscured fraction is clearly higher than our results from
 galaxy-scale gas.
 Therefore a nuclear obscurer is necessary to explain the elevated data
 points.
 The shape of the distribution is driven by the Gaussian distribution of
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH-M_{\star}$
\end_inset

 relation, a shape assumed in Paper I to fit the dispersion.
 Adopting a different distribution, would flatten the tails and permit unobscure
d LOS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that our results are meaningful for the AGN population -- the obscuration
 of individual host galaxies is stellar-mass dependent with substantial
 variations between individual galaxies (see Equation

Our main result is that the host galaxy gas provides a luminosity-independent
 obscurer, for which we compute covering fractions.
 This obscurer does not provide Compton-thick columns, but large covering
 fractions (
\begin_inset Formula $40-90\%$
\end_inset

) at 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH>10^{22}\,{\rm cm}^{-2}$
\end_inset

.
 These high covering fractions suggest that a substantial part of the type1/type
2 dichotomy is due to galaxy-scale gas.
 This is consistent with the finding of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Maiolino1995"

\end_inset

 that nearby type2 AGN are often edge-on galaxies.
 We note that our results tend to produce high covering fractions, which
 are only consistent with the measurements due to large uncertainties.
 We speculate that the use of GRB host galaxies in Paper
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

I may slightly bias our results when applied to AGN host galaxies.
 GRB host galaxies are currently star forming and thus may have slightly
 more gas than the average AGN galaxy (see caveats discussed in Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Methodology"

\end_inset

).
 A correction in the column density by a factor of 2 would agree well with
 data points at all redshifts.
 This is demonstrated by the dashed line in Figure
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Nevertheless, our results are consistent with the current AGN surveys.

Our results give, for the first time, constraints on the galaxy-scale obscurer
 alone.
 We use this in the subsequent sections to disentangle the AGN nuclear obscurer
 from the galaxy-scale obscurer (Section

), and to describe their behaviour as a function of accretion luminosity,
 host galaxy stellar mass and redshift (Section

 we have sketched this decline from 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim70\%$
\end_inset

 to a persistent 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim40\%$
\end_inset

.
 According to our results, this can be interpreted as two scales contributing
 to the obscuration: a 
\begin_inset Formula $40\%$
\end_inset

 galaxy-scale obscurer, and a luminosity-dependent nuclear obscurer.
 The former is constrained from GRB observations (Paper
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

I), re-weighted to the mass distribution of AGN (results of this paper).
 The latter is the remainder to fit the observations.
 According to this picture, the nuclear obscurer completely disappears toward
 high luminosities at 
\begin_inset Formula $L(2-10\,{\rm keV})\approx10^{44.5}{\rm erg/s}$
\end_inset

.
 This luminosity is however redshift-dependent, with higher redshifts having
 higher cut-off luminosities.
 This has been found in many works

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 derived the same result using a non-parametric method, indicating that
 this is indeed a robust result.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Buchner2015"

\end_inset

, the implications for obscurer models were discussed in their Section 5.3.
 They concluded that an Eddington-limited blow-out of the obscurer could
 explain the luminosity dependence.
 As the luminosity dependence is observed to evolve, a black hole mass dependenc
e needed to be invoked.
 If the average, currently accreting black hole is more massive at high
 redshift than at low redshift, the turn-over luminosity decreases over
 cosmic time.
 Such black hole mass downsizing has evidence from optical observations
 of the black hole mass function evolution

Because neither semi-analytic nor hydro-dynamic cosmological simulations

 The PuffedTorus model has few parameters and is constructed so that it

y as discussed above.
 It can also serve as a summary of observational constraints when exploring
 physical models for the obscurer.

Methodology

\begin_layout Standard
We first investigate the gas distribution in the reference simulations.
 We focus on the metal component of gas as O and Fe are, for the relevant
 obscuring columns and redshifts, the most important elements for photo-electric
 absorption of X-rays.
 In galaxy evolution models, the massive end of the existing stellar population
 expels metals into the galaxy.
 The metal gas produced per stellar mass is determined by the chosen IMF
 and the metal yield, with the latter tuned to reproduce the stellar mass
 function 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "e.g."
key "Lu2015"

\end_inset

.
 The total metal gas mass residing in galaxies further depends on the chosen
 feedback models which can expel gas out of the galaxy.
 Typically the metal gas mass inside galaxies follows a 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{Z}:M_{\star}$
\end_inset

 ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $1:30$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $1:100$

, we find that both the EAGLE reference and Illustris simulations produce
 a negligible number of Compton-thick AGN.
 This is consistent with the assumption that Compton-thick obscuration is
 associated with a nuclear obscuration in the vicinity of the accretion
 disk.
 We then compare with observations.
 Downwards-pointing triangles indicate constraints for the obscured fraction
 of luminous, Compton-thin AGN.
 Arbitrary additional nuclear obscuration may be included in them, therefore
 they should be interpreted as upper limits to the galaxy-scale obscuration.
 We find that the Illustris simulation fulfils these constraints, as it
 produces very low covering fractions at all obscuring columns.
 In contrast, the EAGLE reference simulation produces an excess of obscured
 AGN at 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH=10^{22}\text{cm}^{-2}$
\end_inset

.
 This is in violation of observations even when the higher data point from
 low-luminosity AGN is considered.
 At higher column densities, the large-scale galaxy gas of the EAGLE reference
 simulation produces covering fractions consistent with the observations,
 with no need for a nuclear obscurer up to 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH=10^{23.5}\text{cm}^{-2}$
\end_inset

.
 In contrast, Illustris galaxies do not provide column densities of 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH>10^{23}\text{cm}^{-2}$

 This indicates that at least some models reproduce fractions in agreement

 However it also shows that the simulations are limited in their predictive

 This nicely separates the EAGLE physics variations into two groups, one

 Here we find, surprisingly, that both models produce lower obscured fractions

 It is less clear why the WeakFB produces a small obscured fraction.
 Presumably the feedback is not sufficient to vertically puff up galaxies,
 thereby reducing covering fractions.
 However, these variations can be excluded based on their mismatch with
 other observations, e.g.

Next we discuss the effects of feedback from accreting SMBHs.
 In the EAGLE simulation, three parameters affect the triggering, efficiency
 and impact of AGN feedback respectively.
 The equation of state of the ISM can be modified from its reference value
 (4/3) to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 (

).
 The increased sound speed then increases the accretion onto black holes
 in the simulation, which increases AGN feedback.
 Once near the black hole, matter is placed into the black hole with a Bondi
 accretion formula modified by a viscosity parameter.
 Increasing the viscosity (
\family typewriter
ViscHi
\family default
) allows gas to loose angular momentum and accrete more efficiently.
 Once accreted, the temperature of particles near AGN is increased by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta T=10^{8.5}{\rm K}$
\end_inset

, stochastically, bringing the gas into the metal cooling regime.

 variation over the reference simulation because it better fits soft X-ray

 We also point out that Illustris uses relative strong feedback, as it implement
s three different AGN feedback schemes (thermal, kinetic and radiation),
 whereas EAGLE uses only stochastic heating.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
AGN outflows or radiation pressure may decrease the covering fractions momentari
ly.
 We have so far considered 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 simulated galaxies and found that they produce high covering fractions.
 Arguably these fractions are consistent with the covering fraction of low-lumin
osity AGN.
 Therefore, one could propose that AGN feedback at high luminosities modifies
 the galaxy in such way that covering fractions are reduced.
 Apriori this proposal appears unlikely, because nuclear gas should be affected
 first.
 Additionally, studies comparing the morphology of active and passive galaxies
 have found little evidence that these are different, by comparing appearances
 with asymmetry and concentration measures

 Indeed, our results remain unchanged if in the EAGLE reference simulation
 we only consider simulated galaxies with instantaneous black hole accretion
 rates corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $L(2-10\,{\rm keV})>10^{42}{\rm erg/s}$
\end_inset

, assuming a radiative efficiency of 10% and bolometric corrections of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 In fact, because active galaxies are preferentially gas-rich, star-forming
 galaxies in that simulation, the average column density is higher by a
 factor of 2, which increases the discrepancy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clumpy ISM may decrease the covering fractions.
 For instance the galactic ISM is structured into parsec-size clumps with
 filling factors of 
\begin_inset Formula $1\%$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Cox2005"

\end_inset

.
 Such clumps could not be resolved by simulations.
 However, as a LOS passes through large distances of the ISM (
\begin_inset Formula $1-\text{few}$
\end_inset

 kiloparsecs), this clumpiness averages out.
 Additionally, clumpiness would effectively only redistribute the obscured
 fraction to both lower and higher column densities, potentially violating
 the constraints of higher column densities.
 There are also differences in the hydrodynamics code schemes and their
 accuracy.
 However, these are less important than the chosen sub-grid models

To summarise, our obscured fraction diagnostic is a highly sensitive test
 of feedback recipes.
 It can easily rule out feedback models already at early times (e.g.

Conclusions

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

Using only observational relations, we predict the covering fractions of
 galaxy-scale gas as relevant for the AGN population.
 Our findings can be summarised as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Galaxy-scale gas does not provide Compton-thick lines of sight.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Galaxy-scale gas covers substantial fractions of the SMBH population at
 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH\approx10^{22-23.5}{\rm cm}^{-2}$
\end_inset

, sufficient to explain the observed luminosity-independent baseline obscuration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We therefore conclude that heavily obscured AGN are associated with nuclear
 obscuration, and propose the value 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH=10^{23.5}{\rm cm}^{-2}$
\end_inset

 as a demarcation line singling out the nuclear obscurer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We subtracted the galaxy-scale obscuration and concluded regarding the remaining
 nuclear obscurer, that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
a nuclear Compton-thick obscurer with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim35\%$
\end_inset

 covering is necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
a nuclear Compton-thin obscurer is necessary for some combinations of luminosity
/black hole mass.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result is formalised into a semi-analytic model for cosmological simulations
, called PuffedTorus (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 The cartoon of Figure

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 illustrates a possible physical scenario for these three, distinct obscuring
 components.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also investigated the inside of simulated galaxies from state-of-the-art
 hydro-dynamic, cosmological simulations and apply ray-tracing from their
 black holes.
 Some of these simulations produce obscured fractions from their metal gas
 which is consistent with observed populations.
 However, the results are highly sensitive to the adopted feedback models
 and therefore lack predictive power.
 We therefore suggest the Compton-thin obscured AGN fraction as a diagnostic
 to rule out feedback models.
 This diagnostic which can be applied already at early cosmic times (
\begin_inset Formula $z=2-3$

).

Important constraints on how much gas resides in galaxies can be drawn from

 Such simulations evolve the matter density available at the Big Bang into

 Semi-analytic models, relying on dark matter haloes from dark matter N-body

 With AGN host galaxies primarily drawn around the

 A obscurer of column density 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{H}$
\end_inset

 outside a radius 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 has a minimum metal gas mass limit 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{Z}$

 (lines).
 For example, a 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{Z}=10^{9}M_{\odot}$
\end_inset

 gas mass has to be brought withing 100pc to completely enshroud a region
 with Compton-thick column densities.
 Keep in mind that such masses are only found in very massive galaxies (
\begin_inset Formula $M_{\star}>3\cdot10^{10}M_{\odot}$

We present a simple calculation to show that Compton-thick column densities,
 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH>1.5\times10^{24}\text{cm}^{-2}$
\end_inset

) cannot be achieved by accumulating the galaxy gas over several kpc.
 In X-ray spectral analysis, the equivalent hydrogen column density 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH$
\end_inset

 is usually computed assuming solar abundances.
 To mimic this, we convert the metal mass in particles to the number of
 hydrogen atoms assuming solar mass fractions of the nearby ISM from

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
n_{\text{H}} & = & \left.\frac{f_{\text{X}}}{f_{\text{Z}}}\right|_{\text{solar}}\times\frac{\rho_{\text{Z}}}{m_{\text{H}}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Inserting numbers including the hydrogen mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{\text{H}}$
\end_inset

 we find 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
n_{\text{H}} & = & 0.737\times10^{22}\text{cm}^{-2}\frac{1}{1\text{kpc}}\times\frac{\rho_{\text{Z}}}{10^{6}M_{\odot}\text{kpc}^{-3}}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

For example, a 1kpc ray in a region of metal gas density 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{6}M_{\odot}/\text{kpc}^{3}$
\end_inset

 results in a measured column density of 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH\approx10^{22}\text{cm}^{-2}$

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The gas inside a galaxy may be arranged in a multitude of ways to achieve
 a covering with column density 
\begin_inset Formula $\NH$
\end_inset

.
 If we consider only gas 
\emph on
outside
\emph default
 a certain radius 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, the most effective obscurer, i.e.
 the one with the least mass but complete covering, is an infinitely thin
 shell at that radius 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 Its mass is easily computed as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
M_{\text{H}}(\NH,>R)=4\pi\cdot R^{2}\times\NH\times m_{\text{H}}.
\]

\end_inset

Converting to metals using the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\left.\frac{f_{\text{Z}}}{f_{\text{X}}}\right|_{\text{solar}}$
\end_inset

and expressing in conventional units, this limit is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
M_{\text{Z}}(\NH,>R)=2.6\times10^{9}M_{\odot}\cdot\frac{\NH}{1.5\times10^{24}\text{cm}^{-2}}\cdot\left(\frac{R}{1\text{kpc}}\right)^{2}.
\]

\end_inset

Therefore, a metal mass larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $2.6\times10^{9}M_{\odot}$
\end_inset

 is required to create a Compton-thick obscurer outside the central 
\begin_inset Formula $1\text{kpc}$
\end_inset

.
 Or equivalently, a metal mass of 
\begin_inset Formula $2.6\times10^{9}M_{\odot}$
\end_inset

 has to be brought to the central 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{kpc}$
\end_inset

 to act as a Compton-thick obscurer.
 Note that this mass limit scales with the covering factor; for example
 obscuration of 
\begin_inset Formula $10\%$
\end_inset

 of the sky requires 
\begin_inset Formula $10\%$
\end_inset

 of the mass.
 This simple limit is shown for several levels of obscuration in Figure

 already noted that such large masses at radii further than a few 10 pc
 are ruled out in NGC1068 and Circinus because they would gravitationally
 dominate the central region.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Combining this simple limit with the masses of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:MZ-sam"

\end_inset

, we can now conclude that galaxies lack the gas required for Compton-thick
 obscuration with substantial covering factors outside the central 
\begin_inset Formula $1\text{kpc}$
\end_inset

.
 Admittedly, this is a weak constraint.
 However the result holds independently of the geometry of the gas, the
 galaxy type and is also applicable to mergers.
 As an example, lets consider that a 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{\star}=10^{9}M_{\odot}$
\end_inset

 merges into a 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{\star}=10^{10}M_{\odot}$
\end_inset

 galaxy (minor merger), and lets assume that all of its gas (
\begin_inset Formula $M_{Z}\approx10^{7}M_{\odot}$
\end_inset

) is made available.
 That entire amount of gas must land within 
\begin_inset Formula $100{\rm pc}$
\end_inset

 of the AGN in order to completely enshroud in Compton-thick columns.
 More quantitative conclusions depend on the geometrical distribution of
 the gas in the galaxy.
