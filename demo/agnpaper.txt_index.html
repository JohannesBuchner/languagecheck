<h1>Language analysis</h1>
	<a href="https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/languagecheck">This program</a> attempts to assist you in improving your paper.
	Language is ambiguous and subjective, a computer can not understand it.
	All results should be seen as suggestions; think about the highlighted sentences.
	
	<ul>
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> Do spell-checking (in your LaTeX editor, e.g. lyx)
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> Do grammar-checking (in LanguageTool)
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> <a href="agnpaper.txt_topic.html">Each paragraph should open informatively.</a>
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> <a href="agnpaper.txt_tricky.html">Tricky words, Prepositions & Wordiness</a>
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> <a href="agnpaper.txt_wordy.html">Wordiness & long sentences</a>
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> <a href="agnpaper.txt_tense.html">Consistent use of tenses</a>
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> <a href="agnpaper.txt_para.html">Paragraph consistency</a>

	<p>
	This program may help you catch some classes of common mistakes,
	but does not replace careful reading and self-editing.
	Here are some steps:
	</p>

	<h3>Context-level</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> Is the text placed well in context (in relation to wider debate)?
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> Will readers from different contexts understand? Do they require more support?
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> Are there enough inter-text links? References, cross-links to sections, figures. Do you need to be more explicit?
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Concept-level</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> what concept involved? How difficult are they? Do they rely on culture?
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> Have the concepts been presented clearly and in enough detail?
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> What is the argument? How complicated is it? How obvious is the logic?
	</ul>

	<h3>Sentence-level</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> Spot inert sentences. Wordy, awkward connections. Those that do not advance the argument/text.
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> Delete whereever you can.
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> How lengthy are the sentences? How complex grammatically are the sentences? read most difficult sentence aloud.
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> Which sentence is most difficult to understand / easy to misinterpret?
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> Unclear grammar?
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> Add repetition only where useful
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> Consider different modes of presenting
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> How would one of my reader see this text?
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> Put best, shining ideas in the spotlight
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Word/Phrasing</h3>
	Tip: Try reading the text to yourself out loud! (alternatively, try a text-to-speech program)
	<ul>
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> word/phrase unfamiliar?
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> word/phrase ambiguous/confusing?
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> word/phrase synonyms, different meanings? distinct?
	</ul>
	
	<p>Repeat from above.</p>
	
	<h3>Slow reading, secretary-level work</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> Before doing this, it is best to take a break from your text for a day or two
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> Adopt the attitude: "There are bound to be some errors here and it is my job to find them now."
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> Reformat your text to double-spaced lines and read aloud.
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> Check completeness (internal references)
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> Check consistency (nomenclature, policies)
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> Check accuracy (of quotations, values, statistics, references).
	</ul>
	<p>
	
	<h3>Presentation</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> Adhere to style of publisher
	<li><input type="checkbox" /> Check figures
	</ul>
	<p>
	<ul>
