<h2>tricky</h2>
<h5>in agreement -> simplify (e.g. agrees with)</h5>
<ul>
<li>The obscuration from ray-traced galaxy gas can be <b>in agreement </b> -> <em> simplify (e.g. agrees with)</em> with observations, but is highly sensitive to the chosen feedback assumptions.
<li>With our assumed fiducial values we obtain () to () and are therefore also <b>in agreement </b> -> <em> simplify (e.g. agrees with)</em> with those observations.
<li>This indicates that at least some models reproduce fractions <b>in agreement </b> -> <em> simplify (e.g. agrees with)</em> with observation.
</ul>
<h5>there is -> rephrase</h5>
<ul>
<li>Also, <b>there is </b> -> <em> rephrase</em> the usual mass-dependent increase in metallicity.
</ul>
<h5>there are -> rephrase</h5>
<ul>
<li>In the EAGLE simulation, <b>there are </b> -> <em> rephrase</em> three parameters which affect the triggering, efficiency and impact of AGN feedback respectively.
</ul>
<h5>respectively -> double-check that you are pairing lists here</h5>
<ul>
<li>We therefore do not rely on the instantaneous accretion rates provided by the simulations see for Illustris and EAGLE <b>respectively </b> -> <em> double-check that you are pairing lists here</em> Sijacki2015,Rosas-Guevara2016.
</ul>
<h2>double negatives</h2>
<h5>not have -> lack</h5>
<ul>
<li>Combining this simple limit with the masses of Figure , we can now conclude that galaxies simply do <b>not have </b> -> <em> lack</em> the required gas to provide Compton-thick obscurers with substantial covering factors outside the central X.
</ul>
<h2>Contractions</h2>
<h5>can not -> cannot</h5>
<ul>
<li>Therefore we <b>can not </b> -> <em> cannot</em> distinguish whether galaxy-scale obscuration decreases toward the bright end, or increases toward the faint end.
<li>Physical processes giving rise to the luminosity and mass-dependent behaviour <b>can not </b> -> <em> cannot</em> be discussed rigorously within the scope of this paper.
<li><b>can not </b> -> <em> cannot</em> be achieved by accumulating the galaxy gas over several kpc.
</ul>
<h2>Wrong comparisons</h2>
<h5>large fraction -> high fraction</h5>
<ul>
<li>Assuming sampling from random viewing angles, the <b>large fraction </b> -> <em> high fraction</em> of obscured AGN implies large covering fractions.
</ul>
<h2>Ambiguous</h2>
<h2>Colloquial phrases and formal equivalents (not comprehensive, see above)</h2>
<h5>type of -> rephrase, colloquial</h5>
<ul>
<li>However the result holds independently of the geometry of the gas, the <b>type of </b> -> <em> rephrase, colloquial</em> galaxy and is also applicable to mergers.
</ul>
<h2>Common mistakes (A&A frequent changes)</h2>
<h5>albeit -> although (Albeit means "although it be", so it cannot be used with another verb)</h5>
<ul>
<li>The evolutionary model also explains why bright AGN are less frequently found to be mildly obscured than faint AGN Ueda2003,Silverman2008,Ebrero2009,Ueda2014,Buchner2015,Aird2015, <b>albeit </b> -> <em> although (Albeit means "although it be", so it cannot be used with another verb)</em> only qualitatively Hopkins2005,Hopkins2006OriginModel.
<li>The Compton-thick fraction here has been assumed to be constant, <b>albeit </b> -> <em> although (Albeit means "although it be", so it cannot be used with another verb)</em> we note that Ricci2016 claims a luminosity-dependence of the Compton-thick fraction.
</ul>
<h5>compare to -> compare with (unless plural follows / no differentiation)</h5>
<ul>
<li>We now <b>compare to </b> -> <em> compare with (unless plural follows / no differentiation)</em> measurements of the obscured fraction of Compton-thin AGN from surveys.
<li>We then <b>compare to </b> -> <em> compare with (unless plural follows / no differentiation)</em> observations.
<li>We focus on the fraction of AGN with at redshift , and <b>compare to </b> -> <em> compare with (unless plural follows / no differentiation)</em> EAGLE physics variations in Figure X. Observations find a fraction around X.
</ul>
<h5>decrease of -> decrease in</h5>
<ul>
<li>At the highest luminosities, an Eddington limit is required to explain the steep <b>decrease of </b> -> <em> decrease in</em> the luminosity function Aird2013.
</ul>
<h5>Due to -> Owing to, Because of, X causes, as a result of (Due to is ambiguous)</h5>
<ul>
<li><b>Due to </b> -> <em> Owing to, Because of, X causes, as a result of (Due to is ambiguous)</em> the host galaxy, a constant fraction is present at all luminosities and masses.
</ul>
<h5>in the following -> in the next/subsequent X, in the following way</h5>
<ul>
<li>We use this <b>in the following </b> -> <em> in the next/subsequent X, in the following way</em> sections to disentangle the AGN nuclear obscurer from the galaxy-scale obscurer (Section ), and to describe their behaviour as a function of accretion luminosity, host galaxy stellar mass and redshift (Section ).
</ul>
<h5>like -> such as, similar to, the same as</h5>
<ul>
<li>This is a useful summary of observational constraints for torus modellers who would <b>like </b> -> <em> such as, similar to, the same as</em> to reproduce this behaviour.
</ul>
<h5>quite -> ambiguous, reword (rather is also ambiguous)</h5>
<ul>
<li>However, we can use observed obscured AGN fractions to exclude simulations which overproduce them, as these observations are apparently <b>quite </b> -> <em> ambiguous, reword (rather is also ambiguous)</em> sensitive to the assumed physics.
</ul>
<h5>quite -> ambiguous, reword (rather is also ambiguous)</h5>
<ul>
<li>However, we can use observed obscured AGN fractions to exclude simulations which overproduce them, as these observations are apparently <b>quite </b> -> <em> ambiguous, reword (rather is also ambiguous)</em> sensitive to the assumed physics.
</ul>
<h5>Since -> Because, After which</h5>
<ul>
<li><b>Since </b> -> <em> Because, After which</em> the obscuration is host mass dependent, the obscurer is arguably the host galaxy itself.
<li><b>Since </b> -> <em> Because, After which</em> neither semi-analytic nor hydro-dynamic cosmological simulations can resolve the nuclear obscurer of AGN, we present a sub-grid model for post-processing.
</ul>
<h5>as well as -> Overused; don't you mean "and" in a specific instance?</h5>
<ul>
<li>Towards the Galactic Center columns with can be found in the Central Molecular Zone Morris1996,Molinari2011, <b>as well as </b> -> <em> Overused; don't you mean "and" in a specific instance?</em> in the equivalent central zones of nearby AGN host galaxies Prieto2014.
<li>Figure shows results from surveys at the peak of the accretion history ( panels) from Ueda2014 and Buchner2015, <b>as well as </b> -> <em> Overused; don't you mean "and" in a specific instance?</em> surveys which include the local Universe Burlon2011,Ueda2014,Aird2015,Ricci2016.
<li>* We propose that the remaining Compton-thin sky is obscured by galaxy-scale gas <b>as well as </b> -> <em> Overused; don't you mean "and" in a specific instance?</em> a nuclear Compton-thin obscurer according to the formula:
<li>Evidence for the low-luminosity decline was found in surveys of the local Universe Burlon2011,Brightman2011b <b>as well as </b> -> <em> Overused; don't you mean "and" in a specific instance?</em> at high redshifts Buchner2015.
<li>Further relevant for this work it also produces galaxies with realistic galaxy morphologies Schaye2015 and gas contents consistent with observations of CO and HI Bahe2015 <b>as well as </b> -> <em> Overused; don't you mean "and" in a specific instance?</em> H Lagos2015.
<li>The EAGLE reference simulation in a large cosmological volume (L0100N1504REFERENCE) belongs to the latter group, <b>as well as </b> -> <em> Overused; don't you mean "and" in a specific instance?</em> the simulation run in medium-size volumes (L0025N0752REFERENCE, L0025N0752RECALIBRATED).
</ul>
<h2>Prepositions</h2>
<h5>associated to -> associated with</h5>
<ul>
<li>Additionally, a substantial part of the faint AGN population is probably <b>associated to </b> -> <em> associated with</em> secular triggering mechanisms e.g.
</ul>
<h5>assumption of -> assumption about</h5>
<ul>
<li>Under the <b>assumption of </b> -> <em> assumption about</em> black hole mass downsizing, i.e., that the average accreting black hole is more massive at high redshift than at low redshift, the turn-over luminosity decreases over cosmic time.
</ul>
<h5>match with -> match</h5>
<ul>
<li>However, these variations can be excluded based on their mis<b>match with </b> -> <em> match</em> other observations, e.g.
</ul>
<h2>My favorite mistakes</h2>
<h5>shades -> shading</h5>
<ul>
<li>Red lines show our fraction of obscured AGN (y-axis) for a given column density (x-axis), assuming various SMF and SARDs, with <b>shades </b> -> <em> shading</em> showing the uncertainties stemming from the obscuration relation.
</ul>
